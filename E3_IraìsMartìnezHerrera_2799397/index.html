	<h3 align="center"><font face="Ravie" color="#2DE800" size="+3">What are crime series?</font></h3>
	<p><font size="5" color="#FFFFFF"</p>
	
	<p align="justify">A crime drama is a type of drama show which has as its primary focus or heroes people whose main occupation is to investigate, punish or commit crimes—especially homicide, assault, robbery or racketeering. Notable crime dramas in TV history include Dragnet, Hill Street Blues, Homicide: Life on the Street, NYPD Blue, Law and Order, The Sopranos and CSI.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Crime series have been popular for years, it color our view of the world and change how we see things because crimes are happening everyday, unfortunately, and  we’ve all heard stories of violence,we are constantly hearing about crime through the news reports so this kind of series show people things that can happen to them, advertise them without necessarily making it direct.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Women on crime shows are often victims, but they're also detectives, prosecutors, and sometimes even murderers. They're capable of anything, whether it's great or terrible. You're capable of all those things in real life too mostly the great.Getting scared gives you an adrenaline burst that can be really enjoyable depending on your personality type, the added security of being in your own home makes this feel like more of a rush than a panic attack.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Even the big media companies, such as CBS airs shows like Criminal Minds, which is a fictional show about murder, these stories get you wondering, what if I were in that situation, there’s a need to explore the dark side of human nature, there’s a need to figure out what could make us so angry.<p/>

<section id="why">
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Ravie" color="#00F3FF" size="+3">Why I like them...</font></h3>
	<div><p align="justify">Some people, including me, have some kind of fascination with crime dramas, whether it be true crime or fictional crime dramas. For example, there is Investigation Discovery which is an television channel specifically dedicated to the true crime genre.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Since I was a kid there was nothing I love more than turning on the television at night after doing all  my homework and trying to solve a mystery, whether it’s an easily-wrapped hour long case on a show like Bones or a longer, sprawling mystery that slowly expands over an entire season, I’m ready and willing to submit my guesses. Whether it be the beginning search of a murder scene or catching the killer in the end, the suspense alone is just one of the many reasons why I love crime series.</p>
	
	<p>My favourite criminal series are the ones showed in the collage, maybe they were premiered a long time ago but seriously they are my favorite, I enjoy watching them, feel that adrenaline, anger while I see them, I could see them for the rest of my life and I wouldn't get bored.
